ASSIGNMENT 7 - LAB

sort --version
  lnxsrv02 returned 8.4 so I switched to lnxsrv07 to see
  this returned 8.22 which is more recent than 8.6
od -An -t f8 -N 80000000 < /dev/urandom | tr -s ' ' '\n' > random.txt
  used dev/urandom as specified in the assignment
  80,000,000 because 8 bytes each
less random.txt
  confirm that random.txt contains data of the correct format

---SORTING---
time -p sort -g random.txt > /dev/null
  real 36.46
  user 199.72
  sys 0.56
time -p sort -g --parallel=2 random.txt > /dev/null
  real 102.60
  user 196.84
  sys 0.27
time -p sort -g --parallel=4 random.txt > /dev/null
  real 58.82
  user 199.36
  sys 0.44
time -p sort -g --parallel=8 random.txt > /dev/null

  sys 0.53

As we can see, with the initial sort, it takes a while. Then with 2 threads,
it does not improve speed, but slowly with increased threads it improves speed
but not proportionally. This is because more threads will require more buffer.
