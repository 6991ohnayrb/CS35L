wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff
  retrieve provided patch for coreutils
patch -p0 coreutils.diff
  apply just downloaded patch2
make
make install
  after applying the patch, make and make install work fine with no errors
  looking at the patch we know that the originally downloaded coreutils had
  conflicting types for "futimens" and previous declarations.

Check the bug:
cd ..
mkdir tmp
touch -d '1917-10-11 11:00 GMT' tmp/bryanh
touch tmp/now1
sleep 1
touch tmp/now2
  these above commands were provided in the assignment
  the first touch -d creates a file at that specified date
./coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt ./tmp/bryanh ./tmp/now1 ./tmp/now2
  run ls -lt using the coreutils on the new files created
  we see the issue where the oldest file is at the top

To find the issue we must examine the file ./coreutils-with-bug/src/ls.c
We see that inside ls.c there is a sort_files() method

Debug using GDB:
gdb --args ./coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt ./tmp/bryanh ./tmp/now1 ./tmp/now2
(gdb) break sort_files
  sets a breakpoint at the method sort_files we found above
(gdb) run
  runs the command we inputted into GDB
Breakpoint 1, sort_files () at ls.c:2954
  reached breakpoint we set 2 steps above
(gdb) s
  steps into function
(gdb) n
  gets into next line
(gdb) p <varName>
  prints out value of the specified variable
After repeated steps of this, we see that we reach a function that compares
  time and returns cmp_mtime
After further investigation, we see that there is an arithmetic operation
  a.tv_sec-b.tv_sec. With understanding of how integers are stored, we know
  that an integer overflow may occur. We can solve this by using a simple
  binary representation of 0/1 indicating whether a.tv_sec or b.tv_sec is
  greater
mkdir coreutils-bug
tar -xvf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz -C coreutils-bug/
  make a new directory and unzip tar file into coreutils-bug
On the SEASnet Linux server, since time is stored as how long after 1970 and
  as 64 bits. When it is truncated to 32 bits, the negative/positive bit is
  lost, showing a time way in the future
