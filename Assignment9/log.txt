ASSIGNMENT 9 - LAB

I installed Ubuntu.
After the installation process by Ubuntu, I run the following commands.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

ifconfig
  IP address is: 10.0.2.15

sudo useradd -d /home/andrew -m andrew
  create user for my partner Andres
sudo passwd andrew
  set password for newly created user
  password set as "abc123"
cd /home/andrew
  change directory to the newly created user's directory
mkdir .ssh
  create hidden directory for Andrew
ls -a
  confirm directory is made correctly
sudo chown -R andrew .ssh
  change owner of the created directory
  new directory owner is andrew
ls -al
  a option to display hidden files
  l option to see owner to confirm andrew is the owner

STEPS FOR MY PARTNER:
ping 10.0.2.15
  confirm the server is "ping-able"
ssh-keygen
  generates public/private key pair
ssh-copy-id -i andrew@10.0.2.15
  copy the generated key to my server
ssh-add
  adds RSA or DSA identity to the authentication agent
ssh andrew@10.0.2.15
  now that the key is generated and copied to the server, we try to ssh
  this is now successful
ssh -X andrew@10.0.2.15
  this does ssh with x-forwarding
