ASSIGNMENT 9 - HOMEWORK

1. The resulting network is still secure because the bytes sent across are
   encrypted. Private key is not sent across the network.
   Case 1: If our keyboard was tapped, we could use a password-less login
           leaving our password secure. We can still maintain some security
           in this way.
   Case 2: If someone had physical access to the USB, the private key may have
           been exposed! Security would be compromised if the private key was
           was accessed, since now everything can be decrypted.
2. gpg --verify only verifies the digital signature of the tar file. There is
   no validation of who created the file. File is able to be created using
   someone else's name.
   Physically deliver the public key so there is a way to match. Therefore,
   we can match the expected public key and ensure it is the correct one.
