ASSIGNMENT 3 - HOMEWORK QUESTIONS

-----Questions-----
1. Brady's Patch removed "case_long_iso_time_style:" because it was not needed
   The case would never be reached.
2. We would have to watch our for different locales. There is no localization
   enabled in this.
3. Running the script on /dev/null we get an "IndexError: list index out of
   range" exception.
4. Running using Python3, we see an error on line 65. It shows that "except
   IOError as (errno, strerror):" is not the correct syntax for Python3. I can
   determine that Python3 and Python2 have different syntaxes.
