ASSIGNMENT 4 - LAB

git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git
  clone repository as provided on assignment
cd diffutils
  change directory into the just cloned repository
git log > ../git-log.txt
  gets git log and puts into pwd's parent directory under git-log.txt
git tag > ../git-tag.txt
  gets git tag and puts into pwd's parent directory under git-tag.txt
git log --grep="quote 'like"
  greps the result of the git log to find specified commit title
  we see this commit has commit id <62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f>
git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > ../quote-patch.txt
  puts patch into pwd's parent directory under quote-patch.txt
git checkout v3.0
  checks out version 3.0 from the repository
patch -p1 < ../quote-patch.txt
  patches with the provide patch file
  there were a few files to skip on the patches because file was not found
git status
  shows a list of all changed files and untracked files
open all files not *.c in emac
  C-x v = C-x v u to undo the changes
  C-x C-c to exit
  yes to save
git status
  at this point I only see 6 modified files, matching the assignment's info
  cmp.c, diff.c, diff3.c, dir.c, sdiff.c, and util.c were the modified files
find . -name "*.c.rej"
  this step is just to be careful I do not overlook any of the *.c.rej files
  we see that there are two files: ./src/diff.c.rej and ./src/diff3.c.rej
less src/diff.c.rej
  we see there are 5 changes
  I proceed to make all 5 changes
less src/diff3.c.rej
  we see there is 1 change
  I proceed to make the 1 change
git clean -f
  remove all untracked files
git status
  shows only 6 files modified
git diff > ../quote-3.0-patch.txt
  this saves the diffs into pwd's parent directory under quote-3.0-patch.txt
cat ../quote-3.0-patch.txt | wc -l
  this outputs 326 which is reasonable given based on the 300-400 range from
  the assignment
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check
  configure and build the diffutils
diff . -
  verify that the expected quotes are present
diff . --help
  verify that the expected quotes are present
mkdir ../diffutils-3.0
mkdir ../diffutils-3.0-patch
  create directories to save different copies of src
cp -r src/ ../diffutil-3.0-patch/
  copies files from src to ../diffutils-3.0.patch
git checkout v3.0
  checkout version 3.0 again
cp -r src/ ../diffutils-3.0/
  copy files from src in version 3.0 to ../diffutils-3.0
diffutils-3.0-patch/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch/ >
  quote-3.0-test.txt
  compares code and puts diff into quote-3.0-test.txt
diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt
  comparing quote-3.0-test.txt and quote-3.0-patch.txt, the files clearly not
  identical. the changes are not innocuous either.
